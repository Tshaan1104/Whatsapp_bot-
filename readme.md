Features
Send Text and Media Messages: Send messages and media (images, videos) to WhatsApp numbers using Twilio.
Receive Incoming Messages: Handle incoming messages from WhatsApp via webhooks.
Frontend Interface: A simple web interface to interact with the bot, featuring dark mode and message display.
Technologies Used
Backend:

Node.js
Express.js
Twilio API
MongoDB (with Mongoose)
Frontend:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript (Fetch API or Axios for making requests)
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm
MongoDB (or a cloud-based MongoDB service)
Twilio Account with API credentials
Backend Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Tshaan1104/Whatsapp_bot-.git
cd yourrepository
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd Backend
npm install
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the Backend directory with the following content:

env
Copy code
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=your_twilio_whatsapp_number
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
Start the Server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will be running on http://localhost:6000.

Frontend Setup
Prepare Frontend Files:

Place your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the Frontend directory. Ensure your JavaScript file is correctly set up to communicate with your backend.

Serve Frontend:

You can use a local server like Live Server in VSCode or another static file server to serve your frontend files. Make sure it is configured to use port 5500 if thatâ€™s where you intend to run it.

Testing with Postman
Send a Message:

Use Postman to send a POST request to http://localhost:6000/api/whatsapp/send-message with the form data message, to, and optionally file.

Receive Messages:

Set up a webhook in Twilio to point to http://localhost:6000/api/whatsapp/webhook to receive incoming messages.

Handling Secrets
Push Protection:

Ensure that sensitive information such as Twilio credentials is not committed to your repository. Use environment variables and .gitignore to secure your secrets.

Troubleshooting
405 Method Not Allowed: Ensure that your backend route matches the route used in your frontend request.

500 Server Error: Check server logs for specific error messages. Ensure all required environment variables are correctly set.
